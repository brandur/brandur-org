Previously, see [week one](/fragments/one-week) and [week
two](/fragments/two-weeks) of my "drink less beer, get more exercise, eat more
vegetables" experiment. Here are my numbers for week three:

| Day       | Food    | Exercise | Net Relative to 1,200 Cal Goal |
| :-------: | :-----: | :------: | :----------------------------: |
| June 20   | 2,638   | 1,827    | -389                           |
| June 21   | 3,140   | 1,102    | +838                           |
| June 22   | 2,248   | 1,326    | -278                           |
| June 23   | 2,585   | 1,196    | +189                           |
| June 24   | 2,432   | 1,489    | -257                           |
| June 25   |         |          |                                |
| June 26   |         |          |                                |
| **Total** |         |          | **+103**                       |

I started the week at 172 lbs. and ended at 168 lbs (-8 lbs. compared to the
beginning of the experiment).

This week I read the excellent [Food Rules][food-rules] by Michael Pollan. It
champions a number of ideas around diet including avoiding processed foods,
reducing snacking, and favoring vegetables over protein. Most of it is common
sense, but common sense that absolutely needed to be repeated. I'm currently
trying to integrate its suggestsions back into my own habits around food.

Other notes:

* Qualitative measurements are showing better results than weight tracking
  would suggest. As far as I can tell, my muscular build has been improving and
  body fat is diminishing.
* I do a baseline of one hour on the stationary bike every day. This is working
  well, but my legs need a break. It's time to consider other forms of
  exercise.
* Once again, I was able to get in a week completely without soda.
