I previously wrote about my results after [one week](/fragments/one-week) of
above average exercise and paying a closer eye to nutrition. Here's week two:

| Day     | Food    | Exercise | Net Relative to 1,200 Cal Goal |
| :-----: | :-----: | :------: | :----------------------------: |
| June 13 | 2,450   | 1,770    | -520                           |
| June 14 | 1,602   | 1,816    | -1,414                         |
| June 15 | 3,701   | 1,183    | +688                           |
| June 16 | 2,372   | 1,338    | -166                           |
| June 17 | 2,155   | 1,201    | -246                           |
| June 18 | 2,673   | 1,447    | +26                            |
| June 19 | 1,134   | 2,411    | -2,477                         |
| Total   |         |          | **-4,109**                     |

I had eleven major exercise events for the week (i.e. sustained high heartrate
for 45 minutes to an hour).

I started the week at 173 lbs. and ended at 170 lbs., staying roughly on the
same trend as I saw last week. Given that the results so far have been good,
I'm going to continue the experiment another week.
