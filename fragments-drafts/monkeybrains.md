One of the many worst parts of living in SOMA is the construction. Its latest
casualty was my Internet connection which depends on an open view between an
antenna mounted on my roof and an access point installed a block away. A
building across the street had added two more floors and built right into its
line-of-sight. My previously fast Internet connection quickly degraded to a 4
mbit/s link most closely related to a dial-up link from the 90s [1]. To make
matters worse, a new building is also going up right next door, obscuring at
least another 90 degrees of viewing angle and further reducing options for
reorienting the antenna.

A technician from the company stopped by and proceeded to pace sullenly across
my roof as he examined my new circumstances. It was overwhelmingly obvious
inside the first five seconds that prospects were grim. For the next half-hour
he alternated between checking sight lines from various positions on the roof,
dialing back into headquarters to have energetic conversations about local
access points with his colleagues, and staring forlornly at adjacent buildings.
By the end of it I was already mentally shopping for alternate service
providers. As he left, he promised to add a ticket into their system for
follow-up, and to do everything in their power for me, a little like a doctor
might in hushed tones when speaking of a terminally ill relative.

As I was leaving the house this morning I got a response on my support ticket:
they'd been able to use more sophisticated equipment at the office to remotely
reconfigure my antenna to a new access point and that my connection was now
looking great. A quick check on Speedtest confirmed that my connection was back
up to speeds of almost 65 mbit/s symmetrical [2].

I don't understand it, but I'm not questioning things too much. MonkeyBrains
works in mysterious ways.
