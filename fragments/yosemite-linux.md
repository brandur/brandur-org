I caught my first in-person glimpse of Apple's new OS "Yosemite" the other day.
As expected for some time now and confirmed during the latest WWDC keynote,
Apple has decided to double down on the flat design of iOS 7 by bringing to the
desktop. Although "flat" is mostly just an alternative aesthetic, some design
decisions are controversial, like the decision to use Helvetic Neue for the
menu bar and elsewhere. A change in font may seem like a trivial point, but
like other aspects of the flat design, it represents a fairly clear trade of
usability (readability in this case) for a more modern look.

This is a great opportunity for the Linux desktop to shine. By sticking to more
proven design techniques like legible fonts and higher contrast interface
elements, it can demonstrate that it values the user's experience first, and
the visual design du jour as a distant second.

This is somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft's introduction of Metro for the
desktop in Windows 8, which received a tepid reaction at the very best, and was
justifiably condemned at worst. The only problem for Linux is that when that
particular faux pas was made, it was competing for its user base with the
still-shining Apple aesthetic, but those days may slowly be coming to an end.

The temptation to imitate the current trend setters like Apple will be strong.
I hope the various Linux desktop projects can resist, and instead use the
opportunity to pull ahead of the pack.
