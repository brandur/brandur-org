_The Atlantic_ published a great article yesterday on [housing activism in San
Francisco][activism]. It starts out talking about the usual line of the evil
lords of tech manifested in a kindergarten play by a particularly enthusiastic
after-school director. It goes on to point out some of the real culprits:
backwards legislation and deeply entrenched property owners and longtime
residents.

A choice quote:

> But if the musical’s director aim was to present oversimplified truths for
> the sake of social justice, the main antagonists shouldn’t have been evil
> politicians and tech executives—it should have been property owners gleefully
> watching the value of their biggest assets skyrocket as they aggressively
> blocked high-density development.

And on a more accurate version of the kindergarten play:

> The homeowners see themselves as upright “preservationists,” protecting the
> character of their city even as they turn it into a time-capsule for the old
> and rich. In my propaganda play, they’d be sympathetic with the plight of the
> working class, but wouldn’t value them nearly as much as living amidst
> refurbished Victorians. They’d prevail by tricking economically illiterate
> activists into allying with them after sneakily tearing the supply-and-demand
> chapters from their econ textbooks.

And on tenants groups:

> Then the rent-controlled tenants care far more about eviction protections
> than increasing supply. That’s because their most vulnerable constituents are
> paying rents that are so far below market-rate, that only an ungodly amount
> of construction could possibly help them.

The [Reddit discussion][reddit] accidentally points out that the issue is even
more complex. State-level legislation like [prop 13][prop-13] is also doing its
share of damage:

> [Prop 13] creates a few problems. 1. We have no incentive to sell our house
> because our taxes will go up when we buy a new one 2. As prices go up, only
> new residents will bear the new tax burden. Therefore holding onto property
> is a super return on investment. The more I deny new residences and approve
> new business construction (Palo Alto), my property value goes up but I do not
> see increased taxes. 3. Because of the low cap on property tax, adding new
> residents does not add very much money to the tax pool which is another

Not mentioned in either place is that even decisions at the federal level are
contributing to the crisis. Near zero interest rates combined with the
government's seemingly unlimited willingness to guarantee housing loans means
that cheap debt is available to everyone. This drives prices on real estate in
one direction: straight up.

So unlike the after school director's imagination, there is no faceless villain
sitting in a Google-themed secret lair built into a volcanic island thinking
about how to squeeze the working class and minorities out of San Francisco
while stroking a Persian cat. Instead, poor policy or unintended externalities
(if you want to be charitable) at all levels of government have compounded to
produce today's affordability crisis in an effect resembling the [tyranny of
small decisions][tyranny]. Just like everyone else, property owners have their
own best interests at heart and are voting in ways to protect themselves, and
these micro-level campaigns happen to be contributors to macro-level problems.
Unfortunately for activists and non-activists alike who aren't already property
owners, the same complex roots of the problem also make it a complex one to
solve, and it's hard to imagine any of the small measures currently being
proposed ever having a profound enough effect to lead to a widespread
satisfactory outcome.
