title: Gossip From Across the World

You wake up to a massive e-mail backlog like you'd have after a taking a
vacation, you prioritize and respond to it, and you're done. You can reasonably
expect to have only a nominal amount of new incoming mail until the very end of
the workday. Sleep, rinse, and repeat.

This is the reality that I've been experiencing for the last couple of weeks
working from across the world in Berlin. It's a significant change from my home
"gossip" culture characterized by frequent interrupts on HipChat and IM, and a
steady stream of incoming e-mail throughout the day. This model has the
significant advantages like faster turnaround on bug reports/fixes and minimal
blocking when you need help, but it can occasionally feel like a frantic
cross-fire with the "mute" button being the final life preserver keeping you
afloat.

The downside of this eight hour offset is generally slower communication
turnaround, but so far I've found that after the new conditions set in,
colleagues realize quickly that they shouldn't block their work on an immediate
response. The upside is a longer workday empty of the high-frequency
distractions that lead to the churn caused by constant context switching. Large
blocks of time free up for uninterrupted work and deep thought.

It may not be the right long-term model, but it's certainly a peaceful interim.
