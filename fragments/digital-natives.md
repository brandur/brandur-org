From an interview with [Douglas Rushkoff][interview] (early Internet culture
pioneer and author of a book called _Cyberia_):

> **You’ve been credited with coining the term “digital natives” – saying they
> are better equipped to navigate the current landscape. Is it not harder for
> them since they don’t have an experience of anything pre-Google,
> pre-smartphone etc?**
>
> Originally I thought they could navigate it better and my generation were the
> immigrants. I think they have more facility with these networks and platforms
> as they are designed but they have less insight that they are designed
> environments. They don’t see how they are tilted towards extracting value
> from them.

This is really intriguing line of thinking. Like Douglas, I'd always assumed
that the next generation would be technologically adept like ours, but with
even more natural fluency and insight into how all the pieces fit. I think we
can say with some authority today that subsequent generations did indeed become
expert _users_ of technology, but may not have the depth of understanding that
we might have expected them to. They might be able to use a new iPhone app like
Instagram instinctively, but very few would be able to offer a basic
explanation into how any of it works.

To be fair, few people from any generation would be able to go into exhaustive
detail on any technical subjects, but the first generation of digital
"immigrants" had a bit of an edge in that just being able to participate often
required non-trivial understanding of technology. Building a computer from its
constituent parts was a mandatory trial on the road to owning a PC. Getting an
Internet connection often required reading through a modem's technical
documentation and doing some tricky troubleshooting. There were no
click-to-play gaming platforms like today, so playing a multiplayer game of
Quake necessitated some understanding of basic networking. Tumblr didn't exist,
so it was common to learn basic HTML, CSS, and how to deploy a web server to
get a personal homepage online. People even learned the basics of the
advertising industry as the first 468x60 ads with 10c per-click payouts started
appearing.

The error in our thinking was that we assumed people _wanted_ a digital wild
west where they could continue pushing forward on the boundaries of the
frontier. In reality, most people far prefer their cities that safely keep them
insulated from the outside: messaging inside Facebook's blue enclosure,
blogging within the confines of Tumblr, posting photography with the
comfortable filters of Instagram, network play on the hosted servers of
Battle.net, or buying an ready made MacBook. As soon as these easy environments
became available, the majority of the population migrated to them in droves.
