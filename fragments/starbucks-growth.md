The NYT reports today on the continued prosperity of Starbucks which continues
to outpace the market with a year over year 50%+ stock growth. They attribute
this to Starbucks' introduction of [reserve coffees][starbucks-reserve], served
at select flagship stores around the world, which allow Starbucks to keep pace
with the increasingly sophisticated palette of the coffee aficionado.

I suspect that Starbucks' popularity is the same today as it's always been:
sweet drinks under the guise of luxury items. Around the Bay Area, you won't
find a single serious coffee drinker who frequents Starbucks, but a venti
double-shot vanilla caff√® macchiato is sure easier to justify to yourself than
its closest culinary relative: the milkshake of the same flavor.
