I start out writing one of these with the idea that it will be two or three
short paragraphs. More often than not, they transform into multi-page essays
that are proportionally harder to digest.

The words above are some to live by. Shorter prose is clear, pleasant to read,
and in the age of short Internet attention spans, is _more likely_ to be read.
Writing walls of indiscriminate ramblings is easy. Writing succinctly is hard.

But it's a balancing act; just because text is short has no bearing on whether
it's good writing. You may have noticed from your friends who send a lot of

Stephen King has a rule that 10% of words should be cut from the first draft to
the second. There's a lot more to writing succinct text than that, but it's a
good place to start. Here's an excerpt from his book _On Writing_:
