I happened to come across an article about [life in LA][los-angeles-post]
written by someone who's lived in the large cities of Japan and China. She
figures her commute time is close to four hours a day and is saddened when
comparing that to life in Asia where her commutes were a tiny fraction of that,
_on foot_.

Now that I work in San Francisco I can't help but get hit by the same feeling
when visiting Calgary, a city which had an almost unlimited capacity to sprawl
due to its location on the open plains of Alberta, and which has taken the
opportunity to its fullest. When going to see my friends while in town for the
holidays, many trips are 20-30 minutes by car while driving off-hours in good
weather conditions. Trips to a non-adjacent quadrant can balloon up to 45
minutes. Walking in most areas is of course completely untenable; the local
convenience store around my parents' home in Deer Run is 20 minutes away at a
brisk pace, Starbucks is 35 minutes, and the closest train station is almost 90
minutes out. And Calgary is only a city of 1.1M; not even a drop in the bucket
compared to the LA metro area's 18+M.

One thing that is especially striking here is how people here lie to themselves
and others to make their transport situation seem more tolerable. When you hear
a Calgarian say that they have a 25-minute commute, what they mean is that
under ideal traffic conditions (i.e. those not seen until past 9 PM at night)
and hitting the right lights they can make it to work in 25 minutes. Their time
at the 50th percentile is more like 35 minutes, and the outliers involving poor
weather conditions or a bad accident on the highway (around the 90th
percentile) are closer to an hour. The end result is that what's theoretically
an hour a day of commute time is practically closer to double that.

San Francisco has spoiled me in that I can live comfortably without a car and
can reach most places I care to go on foot in a shorter period of time than
what my friends back home can do on four wheels. If I hop on a bike or jump in
an Uber, those times are boiled down even further, and a lot of hot spots are
left only minutes away [1].

What's concerning is just how few San Franciscos there are in North America.
Despite [ever-climbing commute times][commute] and the [recent surge in
popularity of urban living][millenials], we build our cities today just like we
always have: with more and bigger roads, and new communities as low density and
far out as municipalities will allow. The next generation of would-be urban
dwellers will again be pushed out to the fringe communities because that's what
they can afford, and the more accessible inner cities will continue to be the
playgrounds of the rich and the fortunate.

[1] Although to be clear this only works for inhabitants of the city itself.
People commuting in from the suburban towns of the Bay Area face commute times
as bad as anywhere else.
