Five basic resolutions for 2015:

* _Run_ 1700 km.
* _Lose_ 16 lbs. (8 lbs. by the end of June) &mdash; this one's a classic.
* _Play_ a rendition of [_Together We Will Live Forever_ on the
  guitar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7pp2BXGC0) (even if it's a poor
  one).
* _Write_ one [article](/articles) every two weeks and two
  [fragments](/fragments) every one week.
* _Medidate_ four times a week.

As far as work is concerned:

* Ship a sustainable real-time API (i.e. event stream).
* Build out a service for internal API consolidation (i.e. "API umbrella").
* Write something interesting enough to make it to the front page of HN twice
  (I made it twice in 2014, so just hold a steady pace).

Bonus:

* Get two surfing trips in and get moderately good by doing so.
