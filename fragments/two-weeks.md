I previously wrote about my results after [one week](/fragments/one-week) of
above average exercise and paying a closer eye to nutrition. Here's week two:

| Day       | Food    | Exercise | Net Relative to 1,200 Cal Goal |
| :-------: | :-----: | :------: | :----------------------------: |
| June 13   | 2,450   | 1,770    | -520                           |
| June 14   | 1,602   | 1,816    | -1,414                         |
| June 15   | 3,701   | 1,183    | +688                           |
| June 16   | 2,372   | 1,338    | -166                           |
| June 17   | 2,155   | 1,201    | -246                           |
| June 18   | 2,673   | 1,447    | +26                            |
| June 19   | 3,030   | 2,460    | -630                           |
| **Total** |         |          | **-2,262**                     |

I had eleven major exercise events for the week (i.e. sustained high heart rate
for 45 minutes to an hour).

I started the week at 173 lbs. and ended at 172 lbs. The latter number has been
fluctuating between 170 and 172, so I'm showing roughly the same downward trend
as last week. Weigh-in this morning would probably have been more positive if
it hadn't been for the comprehensive spread of snacks at last night's Warriors
viewing.

I got through the whole week without drinking a single soda product (not even
of the diet variety). A small win, but something that I haven't done in years.
I also cut sports drinks like Gatorade. I thought about trying to eliminate
beer next, but in its case I think I'd prefer a strategy of moderation over
abstinence.

I'm continuing to find the experiment beneficial, and will see it through until
at least week three.
