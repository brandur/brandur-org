I really enjoyed [this article on "stuff"][gifts] from Derek Sivers. Every time
I look around my apartment with a critical eye, I'm absolutely floored by the
number of things that I've accumulated since moving in. It doesn't make me
happy, and in fact its cognitive overhead has the opposite effect, but none of
it is junk either; it's all moderately useful stuff that I could imagine
needing at some point in the next year (albeit very infrequently).

Worse yet, I still haven't figured out how to solve the problem except with
periodic purges which are time consuming and wasteful. I do try to buy quality
items that I won't get tired of and which will have some longevity, but even
actively thinking about it, I still catch myself buying new things that are
only nominally useful and which will be difficult to get rid of.
