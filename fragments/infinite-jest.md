![Infinite Jest on a table](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B25yqPsIEAECykQ.jpg:medium)

I just finished David Foster Wallace's magnum opus _Infinite Jest_. Generally
regarded as a work of literary genius, it's also infamous for being incredibly
difficult to read. Rather than following any kind of traditional story telling
techniques, DFW presents us with a series of loosely coupled scenes where a
large number of cast members engage in seemingly meaningless activities or
interact with each other in inscrutable ways. I got a third of the way through
the book before going to find a plot synopsis (in despair); it turned out that
I'd failed to realize what the book was even about.

To anyone about to embark on this journey, I'm going to go ahead and recommend
something that would be profane to _IJ_'s considerable fanbase: an assisted
read. Before starting, read [the Wikipedia article][wiki], twice. Before
starting any chapter or segment, use [the scene-by-scene guide][guide] to find
out what it's about (yes, even by the end of a chapter you may still not know).
Consider getting a copy of [Elegant Complexity][elegant-complexity] as a
companion for your reading.

After you've finished the book, jump over to [what happens at the end of
Infinite Jest?][end] and see how you did on deciphering major plot points. I
scored 0%. If this was any other book that might be a record, but in _IJ_'s
case, that's par for the course. Compared to _IJ_, even the movie _Primer_
looks like an idiotically shallow Michael Bay flick.

> DFW: There is an ending as far as I’m concerned. Certain kind of parallel

It failed for me.
