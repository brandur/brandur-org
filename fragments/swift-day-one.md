Yesterday during the WWDC keynote Apple announced [Swift][swift], a new
programming language squarely targeted at the Apple platform. The original
designer of Rust put together [a great summary of Swift's language
features][features], and I was glad to see that it draws heavily from C# and
Rust.

Swift is an exciting new technology, but for me at least, the technical merits
of the language are a secondary consideration. Like many other modern emergant
languages, Swift is an opportunity to foster a new development community that
has solid technological foundation, but unlike many of those other languages,
it's also built on top of thriving economic forces that can help drive it
forward. I wouldn't be surprised if we see more Swift adoption in its first
four weeks than Go had in its first four years (the same could be said for many
new language projects kicked off in the last few years).

I'm still hoping to see an ecosystem emerge that's a little like the middle
days of C# --- consistently exciting language and platform developments,
backing by major industrial players, awesome tools, and great people and
events, all conspiring to produce amazing products. With Swift now in play,
that time may be coming soon.
