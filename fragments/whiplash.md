★ ★ ★ ★ (out of five)

Best Picture nominee Whiplash is a very emotional production centering around
the relationship between first-year jazz student Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller)
and conductor Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons). Fletcher's style of teaching is
an attempt to motivate Neiman in unconventional ways through a barrage of vocal
and physical abuse along with public humiliation. It does drive Neiman to
excel, but also comes with a steep price on his mental well-being, and before
too long Neiman's life and relationships begin to unravel around him.

Whiplash has a way of evoking in the viewer the raw emotion felt by the
characters in the film thanks to cutting dialog and the short, gritty shots
that pull you right into the movie's reality.

A few examples of great shots that really stuck with me:

1. Fletcher righting Neiman's fallen cymbal during the final drum solo.
2. The close-ups of water beading down the cymbals and reacting to the
   percussion of the instruments.
3. The faceless crowd during the final performance.
4. Neiman's bloody hands.
5. The close-ups on the complex notation of the performer's musical worksheets.

Whiplash was also believable in a way that I wouldn't normally attribute to
fiction. During a meeting after Fletcher's been fired and Neiman's been
expelled, Fletcher explains his actions at Shaffer, telling Neiman that
although positive reinforcement is the typical form of tutelage, only through
tough love can a pupil be pushed to their full potential. The surprising part
here was that Fletcher's argument was entirely convincing and made you
sympathize with even this callous figure.

The very open-ended finish to the movie was a nice touch. A number of questions
of varying levels of importance are left to the viewer's imagination:

1. Does the crowd enjoy the final performance? Although technically impressive,
   the obvious tantrums thrown by both the conductor and drummer might leave
   such a distinguished audience more uncomfortable than appreciative.
2. What happens to the relationship between Fletcher and Neiman? Despite some
   mutual respect shown during the final drum solo, that bridge might be so far
   gone that it's impossible to rebuild.
3. What happens to Neiman's career? Although obviously an impressive drummer,
   he's a college dropout and is probably left without the credentials
   necessary to make it into a respected ensemble. Fletcher isn't too far off.
   Although seemingly still well-respected within the musical community, he's
   lost his position at Shaffer and unlikely to gain another that's anywhere
   near as prominent.
4. Was Nicole in the audience? As shown during the scene where Neiman
   originally asks her out, she isn't beyond telling a little white lie for
   dramatic effect. The new boyfriend may have been a ruse.

This one is definitely recommended.
