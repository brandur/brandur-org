It's Sausalito on a warm Saturday afternoon. The sun is shining and a stream of
bicyclists coasts down the hill into town along the bay-side road. Each cranes
their neck a little to the right to enjoy the views of San Francisco and the
bay. They're a diverse group: American and foreign, rich and poor, tourist and
local, fast riders and slow riders, solo riders and riders with large families,
carbon racing bikes, cruisers, and fixies. Each rides along with a content and
relaxed air about them, enjoying the sunlight and their lazy weekend.

A car slows down and parks on the side of the street. The extra traffic in the
bike lane had made parking slower than usual. A stately woman emerges from the
car's passenger side and looks around with a distressed look on her face.
Before walking the final few steps to the restaurant not far from her door, she
says in exasperation, "They really must do something about all these bicycles!"
