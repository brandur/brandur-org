Previously, see [week one](/fragments/one-week) and [week
two](/fragments/two-weeks) of my "drink less beer, get more exercise, eat more
vegetables" experiment. My numbers for week three:

| :-------: | :-----: | :------: | :----------------------------: |
| June 20   | 2,638   | 1,827    | -389                           |
| June 21   | 3,140   | 1,102    | +838                           |

| June 26   | 2,236   | 705      | +331                           |
| **Total** |         |          | **+282**                       |

I started the week at 172 lbs. and ended at 170 lbs (-6 lbs. compared to the
beginning of the experiment).
