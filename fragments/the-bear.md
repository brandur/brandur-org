I missed my flight this morning and it was my fault. To say that I put myself
in a high risk situation would be an understatement; I was at [DNA's
Cyberdelia][cyberdelia] until closing at 2 AM, then unwisely decided to stop by
the old office afterwards. I got into bed at 3:45 AM with a target wake-up time
at 4:45 AM to make my 7 AM flight. My 20/20 hindsight tells me that I should
have gone to find a good coffee instead. My 20/100 hindsight tells me that I
should have just skipped the whole night.

I'd set myself a cascading series of redundant alarms to hedge against the risk
of not waking up, but I was being too clever for my own good by using Siri to
activate and list them. I'll never know why exactly, but none of them went off.

My eyes opened at 6:46 AM when Air Canada called me. In a herculean (and
ultimately futile) effort I made it from my pillow to the airline counter at
SFO in 24 minutes flat, a new landspeed record from SOMA, but it'd been a
hopeless situation the moment I was conscious. I sheepishly approached the
counter and rescheduled for the next day.

The only good news is that as I was setting up for multi-device redundancy for
the next day's trip, I noticed that the iPad's alarm app finally supports
playing a song instead of the one of the built-in buzzers. Progress!
