Only one of these people is right.

If you haven't taken the time to learn how to properly use a tool so that it
becomes an effective part of workflow, that's fine. It's a personal choice. But
it's intellectual bankruptcy to try and spread this dubious practice by
implying that it has any sort of legitimacy.

It's not desirable or practical to break out a debugger at every turn, but it's
still a tool that should be kept within arm's reach. When it comes to stepping
through and introspecting how an unfamiliar program executes at runtime, or
squashing some of those hardest bugs, there's quite simply nothing else that's
comparable in efficacy.
