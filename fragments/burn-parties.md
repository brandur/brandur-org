Part of running a product company is shipping new features, but the other often
less considered part is regularly trimming the existing inventory. When a
product has been superseded, or the pain it's causing is outweighing the
benefits that it's providing, or it's just reached the end of its useful
lifespan, it's time for it to be retired. And as any engineer who's seen
production can tell you, tearing down a product that has users on it can be
almost as difficult as building one anew. But despite the effort involved, the
work that's been put into a deprecation project is rarely acknowledged to
anywhere near the same extent as it might have been if applied to a new
product.

One somewhat ingenious cultural invention from Heroku is the _burn party_. Its
purpose is to celebrate the work involved in removing things, and thus maintain
a more streamlined company. The mechanics are simple: light up a fire pit or
brazier [1]. Symbolic effigees are prepared to represent dead products. One by
one, each product owner approaches the open fire and explains the sordid
history behind what's being retired and provides a graphic description of the
effort that's gone into its removal.

The effigy is then sacrificed to the open flame.

[1] A bonfire is ideal, but after all, you're probably in San Francisco.
