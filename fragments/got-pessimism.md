[George R. R. Martin announced today][announcement] that _The Winds of Winter_
will not be released before the sixth season of _A Game of Thrones_ on HBO as
had been originally planned; not surprising for many, but the word from GRRM
himself makes it official. The news is important to fans because it marks the
first time that the TV series will pull ahead of the books and forge ahead into
unknown territory.

I logged into [the Hivemind][hivemind] to try and assess sentiment online. It's
not optimistic:

> I feel like absolutely no one is surprised by this.
>
> At this point, it wouldn't even be surprising if the book wasn't released
> before the show ended ...

There were at least a few references a long running gag in fantasy books [1]:

> Fully expecting Brandon Sanderson to have to take over.

Others more seriously call for GRRM to get a co-writer before it's too late:

> Sanderson is the wrong choice for this particular series, but yes, it's time
> to hire a co-writer. He can work closely with GRRM to structure the story,
> get it on paper, and GRRM can rewrite and revise away in his own voice. It
> would be a hell of a lot better than someone else finishing it alone after
> his death, or leaving the HBO series as the only true ending.

And certainly both book releases in the last decade and the recent delays on
_The Winds of Winter_ seem to suggest that that the time to write a book isn't
going anywhere but up:

| #   | Title                  | Release  |
| :-: | ---------------------- | :------: |
| 1   | _A Game of Thrones_    | Aug 1996 |
| 2   | _A Clash of Kings_     | Feb 1999 |
| 3   | _A Storm of Swords_    | Nov 2000 |
| 4   | _A Feast for Crows_    | Nov 2005 |
| 5   | _A Dance with Dragons_ | Jul 2011 |
| 6   | _The Winds of Winter_  | ?        |
| 7   | _A Dream of Spring_    | ?        |

There's also the problem that _A Dance with Dragons_ seemed to introduce more
exposition rather than help prepare any of the books' many divergent storylines
to be tied up. It's now a real possibility that the series will have to expand
beyond the originally planned seven books.

Personally, especially after the test of endurance that was _A Feast for
Crows_, I'm more excited for the new TV season anyway. Season six premieres on
April 24th.

[1] Sanderson is famously productive and stepped in to wrap up _The Wheel of
    Time_ after Robert Jordan passed away before he could finish the series.
