★ ★ ★ (out of five)

Referring of course to [the Pixar movie][wiki], somewhat notable for being
the studio's first created without input from Steve Jobs, _Inside Out_ is one
of the studio's two films in 2015.

As you'd expect from Pixar, Inside Out is creative and funny, but isn't
quite memorable enough to establish itself as one of the studio's great films.
As usual, the movie's world bearing is great, and within moments viewers will
find themselves fully immersed in a world where emotions are figures at a
control center and memories are stored in glass orbs.

It has a few epic moments like when Riley's imaginary friend Bing Bong
sacrifices himself to allow Joy to escape the Memory Dump. Unfortunately
though, some of the challenges faced come off as slightly contrived and aren't
as fully satisfying as they might have been..

The scenes involving San Francisco may have been my favorite part, with some
shots taken at vendors hawking locally-sourced goods that are both healthy and
tasteless, and perhaps the most accurate film-portrayal of Lombard Street of
all time as a bumper-to-bumper traffic nightmare instead of the peaceful
greenery-lined avenue imagined by would-be visitors.
