Habits:

* _Do one thing at a time_. The [hyperactive nature of the Internet][stephenson]
  is taking a toll on my attention span, and I'd like to undo that.
* _Meditate twice a week_. I blew this one big time last year, but I still
  think it's a valuable habit, and want to try for it again.

Health:

* _Run 1600 km_. I made this last year (but failed to hit my target 1700 km), and
  want to do it again.
* _Lose 16 lbs._ (target 160 lbs.). I made it about halfway last year, but the
  excesses of the holiday break undid most of my effort.

Writing:

* _Write one article a month._ Assemble one comprehensive article a month.
* _Write two fragments a week._ Shorter pieces like the one you're reading now.

Work:

* _Ship two major projects._

Hobbies:
