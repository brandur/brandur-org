With my MacBook Air's keyboard [rapidly deteriorating](https://twitter.com/brandur/status/551077429427458051), I went out and purchased my first ever mechanical keyboard: a Cooler Master QuickFire Rapid with Cherry MX Blue switches.

The [different types of Cherry MX switches](http://www.keyboardco.com/blog/index.php/2012/12/an-introduction-to-cherry-mx-mechanical-switches/) found on modern mechanical keyboards has been an area of geek arcana that I've purposely avoided learning about until now, figuring that it belonged to my past life along with applying thermal paste to CPU's and overclocking video cards. After a little reading and on the [strong recommendation of an ex-colleague](http://atreus.technomancy.us/), I decided to go with Cherry MX Blue to optimize for feeling and precision while typing.

I'd originally gone in intending to buy a [Corsair K70](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16823816010), but I ended up going with the QuickFire Rapid to drop the numpad and because the K70's cluttered aesthetic didn't speak to me. I found out later that I was buying a model that's since been superseded by a new version [with more LED's] (the "Rapid-i"), which is something that I can live with (especially with the pre-LED proto-model weighing in at half price).

At first glance I found the QuickFire to be pretty tacky (take a closer look at the "A" to see what I'm talking about), but I quickly came to love its distinctive boxy look. Cooler Master did a good job of practicing restraint in design: the QuickFire isn't embellished with any extra doodads, thingamabobs, or whatsits; just two colours, some very loud keys, and a sleek rubberized case that would make any minimalist proud.

Oh, and did I mention that the keys are loud? The keyboard's switches are indeed the most satisfying that I've ever used, but I can tell that I'm already pushing the goodwill of my family who have had to live through the racket for the last few days. The good news is that the entire city block can now tell that I'm hard at work.

I was curious to see what effect the switch to a mechanical keyboard would have on my typing speed, so I pulled out `typespeed` and took the QuickFire through its paces. Although it was a huge improvement over my current situation, I found that there was no significant change compared to my historical typing speeds. Oh well, at least my fingers are getting a better workout.

The QuickFire makes typing fun again, and that by itself is worth the investment. Recommended.
